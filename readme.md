# Solitaire 33

A game of speed, logic and skill: start with 33 marbles and try to finish with just one marble left in the middle of the board to acheive 'Solitaire'.

### Features 💡
- Build entirely with Vanilla JavaScript and CSS; no front-end frameworks or libraries like React, Vue etc...
- Includes Help section and Leader board
- Completely responsive and mobile friendly
- Scores are saved on the back-end with Google Firebase

### Instructions 🛠
- **Aim of the game**
Take away as many marbles as possible in the 100 seconds countdown.
- **How to take away marbles**
Select a marble so it turns blue then place it over an adjacent marble into an empty space. The marble you move over will be taken. To deselect a marble, click on it again so it turns from blue to gold. See the demo below.
- **Scoring**
Each marble removed increases the score by marbles taken multiplied by seconds remaining. Eg, 15 marbles taken in 60 seconds scores 900. Finish the game at any time to submit your score to the Leader Board.
- **Bonus points**
If you finish with just one marble remaining, which is 'Solitaire', you get a bonus 500 points, and if you last marble finishes in the centre of the board the bonus is 1,000 points!
